# Welcome to GCCentral!
Gaming Challenge Central started off as a thing called "Fun GTAV Challenges to cure your boredom". Fun GTAV Challenges mysteriously disappeared one day, and today i want to revisit that idea. With Gaming Challenge Central (or GCCentral for short). i was originally going to make it a thing og blogger, but then i had an idea: "What if i took it to the Triple W and made it into it's own full blown website?"
I have a whole host of stuff on the list of stuff that needs inclusion, too: 

	Home Page: The main landing page of GCCentral that provides an overview of the platform, its purpose, and highlights the key features and benefits for users.
	
	User Registration and Authentication: A user registration system that allows visitors to create an account on GCCentral. Users should be able to log in securely using their credentials to access their profiles and participate in challenges.
	
	User Profiles: Each registered user should have a dedicated profile where they can view their completed challenges, track their progress, showcase their achievements, and connect with other community members.
	
	Challenge Database: A comprehensive database that organizes challenges by game, category, and difficulty level. Each challenge should have clear instructions, objectives, and rules.
	
	Challenge Submission System: A feature that enables users to submit their completion of challenges. This system should allow users to select the specific challenge they completed, provide relevant details, and upload supporting evidence such as screenshots or images as proof of completion.
	
	Challenge Verification: An automated or manual process to verify challenge completions. This could involve image recognition algorithms that analyze and compare submitted images against the challenge requirements to validate authenticity.
	
	Community Forum: A dedicated forum or discussion board where users can engage with each other, share tips, ask questions, and discuss their gaming experiences. The forum should have categories and threads to facilitate organized discussions.
	
	Social Interaction: Integration of social features such as user-to-user messaging, the ability to follow other users, and the option to like or comment on challenge completions or forum posts.
	
	Notifications and Updates: A notification system that keeps users informed about new challenges, forum activity, replies to their posts, and important updates related to GCCentral.
	
	Leaderboards and Rankings: A leaderboard system that tracks and displays the progress and achievements of users, allowing them to compare their performance with others in various challenges or game categories.
	
	Mobile-Friendly Design: Ensuring that GCCentral is responsive and optimized for mobile devices, allowing users to access and interact with the website seamlessly from their smartphones or tablets.
	
	Admin Dashboard: A back-end administration panel that provides administrative access to manage user accounts, challenge content, forum moderation, and overall website functionality.
	
	Support and Help Center: A section of the website that offers resources, FAQs, and support channels to help users troubleshoot issues, seek assistance, or report any concerns.
	
	Responsive Design: Developing a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that adapts to different screen sizes and browsers for an optimal user experience.
	
	SEO Optimization: Implementing search engine optimization techniques to ensure the website ranks well in search engine results, making it easier for users to discover GCCentral.
	
	Monetization Options: Consideration of monetization strategies such as ads, or some other stuff

And... to be entirely honest, Programming is not my strongest suit. So, i'm looking for collaborators.
